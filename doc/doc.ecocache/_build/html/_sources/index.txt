About EcoCache Foss4g Hackathon

The idea behind the Ecocache project was to capture useful information about the environment across the UK using easily identified object.
An example of this would be the flowering dates of Daffodils across the UK, which starts in the south of the UK and travels north.
By making this as an app for children the aim was to make something fun and engaging that would encourage kids to examine their
environment more closely whilst providing valueable data as the result.
THe aim is to mimic the "Got to catch them all" style of games with achievements and goals in a simple to use app that can be used 
while in the car or out for a walk.
